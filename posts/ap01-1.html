				<p>Human anatomy is the study of the body’s structures. Some of these structures are very small. And they can only be observed and analyzed with a microscope. Other larger structures can be seen, manipulated, measured, and weighed. The word “anatomy” comes from a Greek root that means “to cut apart.” Human anatomy was first studied by observing the outside of the body and seeing wounds of soldiers and other injuries. Later, doctors were allowed to dissect bodies of the dead to improve their knowledge. The body structures are cut apart to see their physical attributes and their relationships to one another. Dissection is still used in medical schools, anatomy courses, and in pathology labs. Imaging techniques have been developed to observe structures in living people, . These techniques allow clinicians to visualize structures inside the living body.</p>

				<p>Like most scientific disciplines, anatomy has areas of specialization. Gross anatomy is the study of the larger structures of the body.  Macro- means “large,” thus, gross anatomy is also referred to as macroscopic anatomy. In contrast, micro- means “small.” Microscopic anatomy is the study of structures that can be seen only with a microscope or other magnification devices. Microscopic anatomy includes cytology, the study of cells and histology, the study of tissues. As technology improves, anatomists can observe smaller and smaller structures of the body. This includes slices of large structures like the heart, to the three-dimensional structures of large molecules in the body.</p>

				<p>Anatomists take two general approaches to the study of the body’s structures: regional and systemic. Regional anatomy is the study of the interrelationships of the structures in a specific body region. Systemic anatomy is the study of a group of structures that work together to perform a unique body function.</p>

				<p>Whereas anatomy is about structure, physiology is about function. Human physiology is the study of the chemistry and physics of body structures and how they work together. Much of the study of physiology centers on the body’s tendency toward homeostasis. Homeostasis is the state of steady internal conditions maintained by living things. The study of physiology includes observation. Current advances in physiology depend on carefully designed laboratory experiments. This research reveals the functions of the many structures and chemical compounds that make up the human body.</p>

				<p>Like anatomists, physiologists usually specialize in a particular branch of physiology. For example, neurophysiology is the study of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves and how these work together. Physiologists may work from the organ level to the molecular level.</p>

				<p>Form is related to function in all living things. For example, the thin flap of your eyelid can snap down to clear away dust particles. And almost instantly it slides back up to allow you to see again. The function of these nerves and muscles likewise relies on the interactions of specific molecules and ions. Even the three-dimensional structure of certain molecules is essential to their function.</p>

				<p>All this will make more sense if you relate the form of the structures you are studying to their function. It can be frustrating to to study anatomy without an understanding of physiology. Imagine trying to appreciate the unique arrangement of the bones of the human hand if you had no concept of how the hand functions.</p>
