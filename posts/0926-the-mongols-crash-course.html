				<p>hi I'm John Green this is crash course world history and today we're going to discuss, wait for it, the Mongols. 

So you probably have a picture of the Mongols in your head yes that's the picture
00:12
brutal bloodthirsty swarthy humorously
00:15
mustachioed warriors riding the plains
00:17
wearing fur eating meat directly off the
00:19
bone saying bar bar bar bar bar bar bar
00:21
I'm sure we imagine the Mongol Empire as
00:24
stereotypically barbarian and that's not
00:26
entirely wrong but if you've been
00:27
reading recent world history textbooks
00:29
like we here at crash course have you
00:30
might have a different view of the
00:31
Mongols one that emphasizes the amazing
00:34
speed and success of their conquests how
00:36
they conquered more land in 25 years
00:38
than the Romans did in 400 how they
00:41
controlled more than 11 million
00:42
contiguous square miles and you may even
00:45
have read that the Mongols basically
00:46
created nations like Russia and even
00:48
Korea one historian has even claimed
00:50
that the Mongols smashed the feudal
00:51
system and created international wall
00:53
renowned for their religious tolerance
00:54
the Mongols in this view created the
00:56
first great free trade zone like a crazy
00:59
medieval Eurasian NAFTA and that's not
01:01
entirely wrong either stupid truth
01:03
always resisting simplicity
01:12
so remember herders we talked about them
01:15
back in Episode one as an alternative to
01:16
hunting and gathering or agriculture
01:18
here are the key things to remember one
01:20
nomads aren't Jack Kerouac they don't go
01:22
on like random road trips they migrate
01:24
according to climate conditions so they
01:25
can feed their flocks to nomads don't
01:27
generally produced manufactured goods
01:29
which means they need to trade so they
01:30
almost always live near settled people
01:32
and three because they generally live
01:33
close to nature and in harsh conditions
01:35
pastoralists tend to be tougher than
01:37
diamond plated differential calculus
01:39
like think of the huns or the Xiongnu
01:41
or the Mongols okay Stan that's know
01:44
back to me come Stan I am the star of
01:46
the show not the Mongols hi sorry about
01:48
that right so one last thing pastoral
01:49
people also tend to be more egalitarian
01:51
especially where women are concerned
01:53
paradoxically when there's less to go
01:54
around humans tend to share more and
01:56
when both men and women must work for
01:58
the social order to survive there tends
02:00
to be less patriarchal domination of
02:01
women although Mongol women rarely went
02:03
to war I can't tell your gender I mean
02:05
you've got the pants but then you also
02:07
have the flu buddy flop so that's the
02:10
technical term by the way I'm a
02:11
historian if you had to choose a
02:12
pastoral nomadic group to come out of
02:14
Central Asia and dominate the world you
02:16
probably wouldn't have chosen the
02:17
Mongols because for most of the history
02:19
we've been discussing they just hung out
02:20
in the foothills bordering the Siberian
02:22
forests mixing herding and hunting
02:24
quietly getting really good at archery
02:26
and riding horses also the Mongols were
02:28
much smaller than other pastoral groups
02:29
like the tatars of the weavers and not
02:31
to get like all great man history on you
02:32
or anything but the reason the mongols
02:34
came to dominate the world really
02:35
started with one guy Genghis Khan let's
02:39
go to the thought-bubble the story goes
02:40
that Genghis or Chingiz Khan was born
02:42
around 1162 with the named Imogen to a
02:44
lowly clan his father was poisoned to
02:46
death leaving Temujin under the control
02:48
of his older brothers one of whom he
02:49
soon killed during an argument by
02:51
nineteen he was married to his first and
02:53
most important wife Forte who was later
02:55
kidnapped this was pretty common among
02:57
the Mongols to merchants mom had also
02:59
been kidnapped in rescuing his wife
03:00
Temujin proved his military medal and he
03:02
soon became a leader of his tribe but
03:04
uniting the Mongol Confederations
03:06
required a Civil War which he won
03:08
largely thanks to two innovations first
03:10
he promoted people based on merit rather
03:13
than family position and second he
03:15
brought lower classes of conquered
03:17
people into his own tribe while
03:19
dispossessing the leaders of the
03:21
conquered clans
03:22
thus he made peasants love him
03:24
the rich hated him but they didn't
03:26
matter anymore because they were no
03:27
longer rich with these two building
03:29
block policies Temujin was able to win
03:31
the loyalty of more and more people and
03:33
in 1206 he was declared the Great Khan
03:36
the leader of all the Mongols how well
03:38
the Mongols chose their rulers in a
03:40
really cool way a prospective ruler
03:41
would call a General Council of called a
03:43
coral tie and anyone who supported his
03:45
candidacy for leadership would show up
03:47
on their horses literally voting with
03:50
their feet mr. green mr. green but
03:52
horses don't have feet they have hooves
03:54
I hate you me from the past also no
03:56
interrupting the thought bubble after
03:57
uniting the Mongols Genghis Khan went on
03:58
to conquer a lot of territory by the
04:01
time he died in his sleep in 1227 his
04:03
empire stretched from the Mongol
04:05
homeland in Mongolia all the way to the
04:08
Caspian Sea thanks thought-bubble so
04:09
that's a pretty good-looking empire and
04:11
sure a lot of it was pasture or
04:12
mountains or desert but the Mongols did
04:15
conquer a lot of people too and in some
04:17
ways with Genghis as death the Empire
04:18
was just getting started his son Oh God
04:20
icon expanded the Empire even more and
04:22
Genghis his grandson monka was the Great
04:24
Khan in 1258 when Baghdad the capital of
04:27
the Abbasid Empire fell to the Mongols
04:29
and another of genghis grandsons Kublai
04:31
Khan conquered the Song Dynasty in China
04:33
in 1279 and if the Mamluks hadn't
04:35
stopped another of genghis grandsons at
04:37
the Battle of I'm Jo luta they probably
04:39
would have taken all of North Africa and
04:41
Genghis Khan sure had a lot of grandkids
04:42
almost be time for the open letter
04:47
an open letter to Genghis Khan's
04:49
descendants of the first let's check
04:50
what's in the secret compartment today
04:52
Oh a noisemaker and champagne popper
04:55
Stan you know I suck at these what's all
04:57
this for
04:57
oh it's because it's a birthday party
05:00
yeah happy birthday to Genghis Khan's
05:03
descendants how do I know what your
05:04
birthday Genghis Khan's descendants
05:06
because every day is your birthday
05:08
because right now on the planet Earth
05:10
there are 16 million direct descendants
05:14
of Genghis Khan meaning that every day
05:16
is the birthday of 43 thousand of them
05:19
so good news Genghis Khan your empire
05:20
might be gone but your progeny lives on
05:23
and on and on and on happy birthday best
05:28
wishes John Green unfortunately for the
05:30
Mongols those guys weren't always
05:31
working together because Genghis Khan
05:33
failed to create a single political unit
05:36
out of his conquests instead after
05:38
genghis is death the Mongols were left
05:39
with four really important empires
05:41
called Connie the Yuan Dynasty in China
05:43
the ilkhanate in Persia the chaga daikon
05:46
ate in Central Asia and the Khanate of
05:48
the Golden Horde in Russia if you
05:49
remember all the way back to the
05:50
Hellenistic period this is similar to
05:52
what happened to another good general
05:53
who wasn't much for administration
05:55
Alexander the Great also neither of them
05:57
ever conquered India the Mongols
05:58
succeeded primarily because of their
06:00
military skill Genghis Khan's army which
06:01
never numbered more than 130,000 was
06:04
built on speed and archery just like
06:06
this guy Mongol mounted archers were
06:08
like super fast tanks compared to the
06:10
foot soldiers and Knights they were up
06:11
against but wait all the military
06:12
history nerds are saying once people
06:14
knew the Mongols were coming why didn't
06:15
they just hole up in castles and forts
06:17
it's not like the Mongols had flying
06:19
horses
06:19
except they did they didn't Stan why are
06:22
you always making history boring so the
06:25
Mongols apparently didn't have flying
06:26
horses but they were uncommon ly
06:28
adaptable so even though they'd never
06:30
seen a castle before they started
06:32
raiding they became experts at siege
06:33
warfare by interrogating prisoners and
06:35
they also adopted gunpowder probably
06:37
introducing it to Europeans and they
06:38
even built ships so they could attack
06:40
Japan that might have worked too except
06:42
there happened to be a typhoon also
06:43
people were terrified of the Mongols
06:45
often cities would surrender the moment
06:47
the Mongols arrived just to escape
06:49
slaughter but of course that only
06:50
happened because there were occasions
06:52
when the Mongols did you know slaughter
06:54
entire towns so with all that background
06:55
let's return to the question of Mongol
06:57
awesomeness first
06:59
arguments for awesome one the mongols
07:01
really did reinvigorate cross Eurasian
07:03
trade the Silk Road trading routes that
07:05
had existed for about a thousand years
07:07
by the time the Mongols made the scene
07:08
had fallen into disuse but the Mongols
07:10
valued trade because they could tax it
07:13
and they did a great job of keeping
07:14
their empire safe it was said that a man
07:16
could walk from one end of the Mongol
07:18
Empire to the other with a gold plate on
07:20
his head without ever fearing being
07:22
robbed to the Mongols increased
07:23
communication through Eurasia by
07:24
developing this Pony Express like system
07:27
of weigh stations with horses and riders
07:29
that could quickly relay information it
07:31
was called the Yama system and it also
07:32
included these amazing bronze passports
07:34
which facilitated travel 3 another thing
07:36
that traveled along Mongol trade routes
07:38
was cuisine for example it was because
07:40
of the Mongols that rice became a staple
07:42
of the Persian diet which I mentioned
07:43
entirely because I happen to like
07:45
Persian food for the Mongols forcibly
07:47
relocated people who were useful to them
07:49
like artists and musicians and
07:51
especially administrators as you can
07:52
imagine the Mongols weren't much for
07:53
administrative tasks like keeping
07:55
records so they found people who were
07:57
good at that stuff and just moved them
07:58
around the Empire this created the kind
08:00
of cross-cultural pollination that world
08:02
historians these days get really excited
08:04
about and five the Mongols were almost
08:06
unprecedented ly tolerant of different
08:08
religions they themselves were shamaness
08:10
--tz-- believing in nature spirits but
08:11
since their religion was tied to the
08:13
land from which they came they didn't
08:15
expect new people to adopt it and they
08:17
didn't ask them to so you could find
08:19
Muslims and Buddhists and Christians and
08:20
people of any other religion you can
08:21
think of prospering throughout the
08:23
Mongol Empire and it's that kind of
08:24
openness that has led historians to go
08:26
back and reevaluate the Mongols seeing
08:28
them as kind of a precursor to modernity
08:29
but there is another side of the story
08:31
that we should not forget so here are
08:33
five reasons why the Mongols might not
08:35
be so great one here is genghis khan's
08:37
definition of happiness the greatest
08:39
happiness is to vanquish your enemies to
08:41
chase them before you to rob them of
08:43
their wealth to see those dear to them
08:45
bathed in tears to clasp to your bosom
08:48
their wives and daughters off topic but
08:50
if that quote rings a bell it might be
08:51
because oliver stone blatantly
08:53
plagiarized genghis khan in the movie
08:55
Conan the Barbarian too is an extension
08:57
of one the Mongols were seriously brutal
09:00
conquerors I mean not uniquely brutal
09:02
but still the Mongols often destroyed
09:04
entire cities and most historians
09:05
estimate the number they killed to be in
09:07
the millions three their empire didn't
09:09
last within 80 years they'd left China
09:11
and been replaced by a new Dinah
09:12
see the Ming and in Persia they blended
09:15
in so completely that by the 15th
09:16
century they were totally unrecognizable
09:18
I mean they'd even taken up agriculture
09:20
agriculture the last refuge of
09:22
scoundrels who wanted to vote their
09:24
lives to working instead of
09:25
skoodilypooping they also weren't
09:26
particularly interested in artistic
09:28
patronage or architecture I mean your
09:30
palace may last forever but my yurt can
09:32
go anywhere five the mongols were
09:34
probably responsible for the Black Death
09:36
by opening up trade they also opened up
09:38
vectors for disease to travel in the
09:40
case of the plague via fleas infected
09:42
with your sin eeeh pestis and at least
09:43
according to one story the Mongols
09:44
intentionally spread the plague by
09:46
catapulting their plague-ridden cadavers
09:48
over the walls of kapha in the Crimea
09:50
while this primitive act of biological
09:51
warfare might have happened it's
09:53
unlikely to be what actually spread the
09:55
plague more likely it was the fleas on
09:57
the rats in the holds of black sea ships
09:59
that were trading with Europe but that
10:00
trade only existed because of the
10:03
Mongols all right Stan one last time
10:05
cue the montage so the Mongols promoted
10:09
trade diversity and tolerance and they
10:12
also promoted slaughter and senseless
10:13
destruction and what you think about the
10:15
Mongols ends up saying a lot about you
10:17
do you value artistic output over
10:18
religious diversity is imperialism that
10:20
doesn't last better or worse than
10:22
imperialism that does and are certain
10:24
kinds of warfare inherently wrong if you
10:26
think those are easy questions to answer
10:27
then I haven't been doing my job
10:29
regardless I look forward to reading
10:30
your answers in comments thanks for
10:32
watching and I'll see you next week
10:33
crash course is produced and directed by

Danica Johnson the show is written by my
10:38
high school history teacher Raoul Meyer
10:39
and myself and our graphics team is
10:41
thought bubble last week's phrase of the
10:43
week was Hawaiian pizza if you want to
10:44
suggest future phrases of the week or
10:46
guess it this week's you can do so in
10:48
comments where you can also ask
10:49
questions about today's video that can
10:50
be answered by our team of historians by
10:52
the way if you want to where your love
10:53
for crash course there's a Mongo shirt
